                                  ;; with no equal elements, while the tests here that use these functions require that combinations be calculated based on object
                                  ;; equality.  Note that the units library does not create this behavior; it would result if the combinatorics functions were used
                                  ;; on simple Java numerics with repeated numbers as well.
